The CAAX-box proteins undergo three sequential, enzymatic, post-translational modifications essential to their targeting: First, the proteins are prenylated by one of two prenyltransferases called farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase-I. Prenylation results in the covalent attachment of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid groups to the cysteine in the CAAX box motif.
